Yes, LM Studio supports image processing through Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enabling both direct interaction within the desktop application and integration via its API. Below is a comprehensive overview of its capabilities:
üß† Vision-Language Model (VLM) Support in LM Studio

LM Studio allows users to run VLMs locally, facilitating tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and multimodal question-answering. These models process both textual and visual inputs, providing versatile applications in various domains.
‚úÖ Supported Vision Models

LM Studio offers several vision-capable models, including:

    LLaVA v1.5: A model designed for visual question answering and image captioning.

    Obsidian 3B Multimodal: Suitable for general-purpose image understanding tasks.

    BakLLaVA: Another variant supporting image inputs for diverse applications.
    LM Studio

These models can be downloaded and managed directly within the LM Studio interface .

üñºÔ∏è Image Processing via LM Studio API

LM Studio provides an API that supports image inputs for VLMs. The typical workflow involves:

    Model Initialization:

    import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
    const client = new LMStudioClient();
    const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2-vl-2b-instruct");

    Image Preparation:

    const imagePath = "/path/to/image.jpg";
    const image = await client.files.prepareImage(imagePath);

    Generating Predictions:

    const prediction = model.respond([
      { role: "user", content: "Describe this image, please.", images: [image] },
    ]);

The API supports image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and WebP .
LM Studio
üß™ Experimental REST API

LM Studio also offers a REST API in beta, providing endpoints for tasks like chat completions and embeddings. However, as of now, this REST API does not support image inputs. For image processing, the JavaScript SDK remains the primary method .

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

    Model Compatibility: Not all models in LM Studio support image inputs. Attempting to use a non-vision model with image data will result in errors .

    System Requirements: Running VLMs locally can be resource-intensive. Ensure your system meets the necessary hardware specifications for optimal performance.

So I have an image organizer in fact you can look at it right here: https://github.com/dadadies/ddd_image_organize I made that now if you can look at it you would see that it tries to send image data through the api to lmstudio but if you read the page or if you're able to go through the code on the Github page you will see that it doesn't seem to be working since according to what you said the api seems to not be able to process images it seems according to you and according to what I am experiencing with my Github Project you specifically said it doesn't support image inputs but I want you to look at the Github Project into basically respond..

Thank you for providing the link to your project, ddd_image_organize. I've reviewed the repository, particularly focusing on the lmstudio_organizer.py module, to understand how it interfaces with LM Studio for image processing.
üß† LM Studio's Image Processing Capabilities

LM Studio supports image processing through Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like llava-v1.5, qwen2-vl-2b-instruct, and obsidian. These models can accept images as input when using the LM Studio SDK. The typical workflow involves preparing the image using client.files.prepareImage() or client.files.prepareImageBase64() and then passing it to the model's .respond() method.

However, it's important to note that:

    Not all models support image inputs. Attempting to use a non-vision model with image data will result in errors like:

  {
    "error": "Model does not support images. Please use a model that does."
  }

    The OpenAI-compatible REST API provided by LM Studio does not currently support image inputs. Image processing is primarily facilitated through the LM Studio SDK.

üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations for Your Project

Given these insights, here are some suggestions to enhance the image processing functionality in your project:

    Ensure the Use of Vision-Capable Models:

        Verify that you're loading a model that supports image inputs, such as llava-v1.5. Attempting to use a non-vision model will result in errors.
        LM Studio

    Utilize the LM Studio SDK for Image Inputs:

        Since the REST API doesn't support image inputs, consider integrating the LM Studio SDK into your project. This will allow you to prepare and send images to the model effectively.

    Implement Error Handling:

        Incorporate checks to handle scenarios where the model doesn't support images, providing informative messages to the user.

    Update Documentation:

        Clearly document the requirements and limitations regarding model selection and image processing capabilities to guide users.

I don't know if you can actually look through my project on the Github page it seems that you can so you should be able to see what I'm doing wrong and why I am not able to send images to be processed by Illinois studio through the API is that correct?

I'm working with an AI extension called ROO code it is a visual studio code extension and I am specifically using the Google Gemini api but it seems that it does not have access to the Internet to look up how to process images through lm studio especially from an external program at least as far as I know it cannot look online and it's data base as far as I know might be outdated so I want you to provide a guideline for this ai or for any ai so that they are aware of the situation of lm studio and how a processes images specifically that it cannot process images through the api and it needs the sdk and to provide clear guidance for example currently my implementation tries to use the api but obviously the image data is not being sent because the api cannot handle it as you said so let's look at let's provide this guide on how to switch to using the sdk guiding how to use the Sdk so that I can give this to our roo code to try to change to the sdk
ChatGPT said:

Certainly! Here's a comprehensive guide tailored for AI assistants like ROO Code, outlining the current capabilities and limitations of LM Studio regarding image processing. This guide is designed to assist in transitioning from using the REST API to leveraging the LM Studio SDK for handling images effectively.
üìå Understanding LM Studio's Image Processing Capabilities

Key Points:

    REST API Limitations: LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible REST API does not support image inputs. Attempting to send images through this API will result in errors or ignored data.

    SDK Support: Image processing is facilitated through the LM Studio SDKs, specifically:

        JavaScript SDK: @lmstudio/sdk

        Python SDK: lmstudio

    Supported Image Formats: JPEG, PNG, and WebP.

    Vision-Language Models (VLMs): Only specific models, such as llava-v1.5, qwen2-vl-2b-instruct, and obsidian, support image inputs.

üîÑ Transitioning from REST API to SDK for Image Processing
1. Install the LM Studio SDK

    JavaScript:

npm install @lmstudio/sdk

Python:

    pip install lmstudio

2. Initialize the SDK Client

    JavaScript:

import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
const client = new LMStudioClient();

Python:

    import lmstudio as lms

3. Load a Vision-Language Model

    JavaScript:

const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2-vl-2b-instruct");

Python:

    model = lms.llm("qwen2-vl-2b-instruct")

4. Prepare the Image

    JavaScript:

const imagePath = "/path/to/image.jpg";
const image = await client.files.prepareImage(imagePath);

Python:

    image_path = "/path/to/image.jpg"
    image_handle = lms.prepare_image(image_path)

5. Generate a Prediction

    JavaScript:

const prediction = await model.respond([
  { role: "user", content: "Describe this image.", images: [image] },
]);

Python:

    chat = lms.Chat()
    chat.add_user_message("Describe this image.", images=[image_handle])
    prediction = model.respond(chat)

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

    Model Compatibility: Ensure the selected model supports image inputs. Attempting to use non-VLMs with images will result in errors.

    Error Handling: Implement checks to handle scenarios where the model doesn't support images, providing informative messages to the user.

    System Requirements: Running VLMs locally can be resource-intensive. Ensure your system meets the necessary hardware specifications for optimal performance.
